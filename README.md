# Anki-Svenska

Resources to learn Swedish using Anki

Some parts, like pronounciation, might be tied to Dutch rather than English. The main resources, should, still be usefull for whomever needs them. I highly recommend making them yourself though, as typing the words in for yourself will most likely help you retain them in the first place!

As a general rule of thumb, my Anki cards have the following fields:

- Dutch: the dutch word/base language entry
- Svenska: the Swedish word
- Pronounciation: again, from dutch, how to pronounce (only shown on anwsers)
- Extra: any extra info that could be relevant (only shown on anwsers)
- Tags
